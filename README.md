Automated Malware Analysis Tool is an all-in-one deployment framework which creates an orchestrated malware analysis environment automatically. The tool uses other pre-configured and industry standard automation frameworks such as FAME, MASTIFF, Cuckoo, Viper, and MISP. AMAT is a simple solution which tackles the tedious and time consuming task of creating a suitable environment for both static and dynamic techniques of malware analysis.
